# Implementation Plan - Network Commands & Educational Content

## Strategy

**Approach**: Implement network commands with educational content integration, then create missions that use them.

**Order**:
1. Ping command + educational content
2. Traceroute command + educational content  
3. Nslookup command + educational content
4. Network missions using these commands
5. Enhanced educational pop-ups system

## Phase 1: Ping Command (Current Focus)

### Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Create network simulation system
2. ✅ Implement ping command
3. ✅ Add educational explanations
4. ✅ Create ping mission
5. ✅ Add visual feedback

### Educational Goals
- Understand what ping does
- Learn about ICMP protocol
- Understand latency/response times
- Learn about network connectivity testing

## Phase 2: Traceroute Command

### Implementation Steps
1. Create network topology simulation
2. Implement traceroute command
3. Add educational explanations
4. Create traceroute mission

### Educational Goals
- Understand network routing
- Learn about network hops
- Understand how data travels across networks

## Phase 3: Nslookup Command

### Implementation Steps
1. Create DNS simulation system
2. Implement nslookup command
3. Add educational explanations
4. Create DNS mission

### Educational Goals
- Understand DNS resolution
- Learn about DNS record types
- Understand domain name system

## Phase 4: Educational Content System

### Implementation Steps
1. Create educational pop-up component
2. Add command-first-use detection
3. Integrate diagrams
4. Create learning notes system

## Phase 5: Mission Expansion

### New Missions
1. Network Connectivity Mission (ping)
2. Network Topology Mission (traceroute)
3. DNS Exploration Mission (nslookup)
4. Network Security Mission (combines all)
