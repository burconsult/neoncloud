# NeonCloud - Educational Network Security Game

An educational hacking simulation game inspired by Uplink, designed to teach young players about internet infrastructure, networking, and cybersecurity concepts in a safe, engaging environment.

## 🎯 Project Vision

NeonCloud transforms complex networking and cybersecurity concepts into an accessible, game-based learning experience. Players take on the role of a network security intern, learning through hands-on challenges that mirror real-world scenarios without the risks.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Players interact with a terminal-style interface to:
- Explore network topologies
- Understand routing and DNS
- Learn about security protocols (HTTPS, TLS, etc.)
- Practice ethical hacking concepts
- Build understanding of internet infrastructure layers

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (for modern UI/UX)
- **Terminal Emulator**: Custom terminal component with command parsing
- **Game Engine**: Custom state management with educational content system
- **Styling**: CSS with retro-futuristic aesthetic
- **Icons**: Lucide React (programmatic icon library)
- **Diagrams**: Programmatically generated SVG diagrams
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast development)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits
