This is your first real operational mission.\n\n**Target Information:**\n- Server ID: server-01\n- IP Address: 192.168.1.100\n- Purpose: Internal file server\n- Security Level: Basic\n\n**Mission Objectives:**\n1. Acquire necessary tools (VPN, Password Cracker) from the store\n2. Connect to VPN for anonymity\n3. Extract server credentials from the encrypted file attached to this email\n4. Connect to server-01 using the extracted credentials\n5. Access the target file located at /home/data/secret.txt\n6. Disconnect and report back\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Use VPN to protect your identity during this operation\n- The attached file contains encrypted credentials - you'll need your password cracker tool\n- Server access requires both username and password\n- Always disconnect when your mission is complete\n\nThe encrypted credentials file is attached. Extract the password, then connect using:\n  Username: admin\n  Password: [extract from encrypted file]\n\nGood luck, Agent. This is your chance to prove your capabilities.\n\nNC-SCOG Operations\ncontracts@neoncloud-ops.org",
